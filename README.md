The identification of patents in a specific technological area is a critical step during the early phases of an R\&D project. It is especially important for scientists and researchers to understand which patents are relevant to their research areas in order to maximize intellectual property (IP) value and identify emerging challenges, as well as is essential for industries, as it offers valuable insights into technological developments, market competition, and innovation prospects. In this work, we introduce a weakly supervised deep learning framework for patent identification within a defined domain. To achieve this, the training dataset was generated by leveraging multiple weak supervision sources, such as heuristics, patterns, and domain knowledge. The weak supervision approach combines several inexpensive but imprecise label estimations to create high-quality labels for further training. A language model is fine-tuned a pre-trained for the patent identification task by adapting its hyperparameters and training it on the training dataset, enabling the model to learn domain-specific patterns and improve classification accuracy. The model evaluated  on unseen test data by using key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Finally, the performance achieved against In-Context learning approach was compared.
